"Crime Dynamics and Economic Factors During COVID-19 in New York State"

**Project Title:** Crime Dynamics and Economic Factors During COVID-19 in New York State
**Tools/Technologies Used:** DBSCAN for clustering, Linear Regression analysis, data visualization tools (e.g., Python, R, Tableau)

**Overview:** Conducted an in-depth analysis of the interplay between crime rates, unemployment, and median household income in New York State during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study focused on unraveling the complex, bidirectional impact of the pandemic on crime trends, challenging historical correlations between economic factors and crime rates.

**Key Findings:**
* Identified a significant deviation from traditional crime-economic correlations during pandemic-induced isolation, with a notable decrease in minor offenses and an unexpected surge in financial crimes post-isolation.
* Utilized temporal and spatial analyses to explore variations across counties, revealing no significant differences in crime trends between rural and urban areas, and highlighting the predominance of financial crimes in influencing overall crime rates during the study period.
* Demonstrated the unpredictability of pandemic and post-pandemic crime trends through linear regression models, emphasizing the diminished predictive power of unemployment and household income on crime rates during this time.
